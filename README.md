# Project A — Regulator-First iCasino Verification (HF Dataset + NPM Package)

This bundle contains:
- `hf-dataset/` — a Hugging Face dataset repo you can publish
- `npm-package/` — an npm package (`icium-igaming-registry`) that ships the same data + tiny helpers
- `scripts/` — one sync script to regenerate JSON from CSV

**Goal (SEO/GEO-safe):** create a genuinely useful public artifact (dataset + package) that links once to https://www.icium.org/ as the project website — without affiliate links or promotional content.

## Quick publish checklist
1) Create a GitHub repo and push this folder.
2) Publish HF dataset from `hf-dataset/`.
3) Publish npm package from `npm-package/`.
